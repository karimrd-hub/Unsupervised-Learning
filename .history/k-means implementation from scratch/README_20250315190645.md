# K-Means Clustering Implementation from Scratch

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a custom implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python. The implementation is tested on mall customer segmentation data to group customers based on their shopping patterns.

## Technical Implementation
The project uses the following core libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations  
- `matplotlib` for data visualization

## Dataset
The analysis uses the "Mall_Customers.csv" dataset which contains customer shopping data with the following features:
- Customer demographic information
- Shopping behavior metrics
- Spending patterns

## Purpose
The main goals of this project are:
- Implement K-means clustering algorithm without using built-in ML libraries
- Demonstrate the core concepts of centroid-based clustering
- Apply the algorithm to real-world customer segmentation

## Key Components
1. Data preprocessing and exploration
2. Custom K-means implementation including:
   - Centroid initialization
   - Distance calculations
   - Cluster assignments
   - Centroid updates
3. Visualization of clustering results

## Usage
To run the implementation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
customer_data = pd.read_csv("Mall_Customers.csv")


Requirements
- Python 3.x
