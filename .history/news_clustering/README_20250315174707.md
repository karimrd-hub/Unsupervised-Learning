# News Clustering Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements unsupervised learning techniques to cluster news articles based on their content using natural language processing and various clustering algorithms.

## Technical Implementation
The project uses multiple machine learning libraries and techniques:

### Text Processing
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Stop words removal
- Porter Stemming algorithm
- String manipulation for text cleaning

### Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

### Clustering Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
- Silhouette Analysis for cluster evaluation

## Dependencies
```python
nltk
scikit-learn
scipy

Key Components
1.Text Preprocessing

- Stop words removal for cleaning irrelevant words
- Porter Stemming for normalizing words
- Punctuation handling

2.Feature Extraction

- TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text to numerical features
- PCA for reducing dimensionality while preserving information

3. Clustering Analysis

- Multiple clustering approaches:
    - K-Means for partitional clustering
    - Hierarchical clustering for tree-based grouping
- Silhouette scoring for evaluating cluster quality
