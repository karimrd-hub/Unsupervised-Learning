# News Clustering Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements unsupervised learning techniques to cluster news articles based on their content using natural language processing and various clustering algorithms.

## Technical Implementation
The project uses multiple machine learning libraries and techniques:

### Text Processing
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Stop words removal
- Porter Stemming algorithm
- String manipulation for text cleaning

### Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

### Clustering Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
- Silhouette Analysis for cluster evaluation

## Dependencies
```python
nltk
scikit-learn
scipy
