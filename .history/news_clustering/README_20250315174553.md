# News Clustering Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements unsupervised learning techniques to cluster news articles based on their content using natural language processing and various clustering algorithms.

## Technical Implementation
The project uses multiple machine learning libraries and techniques:

### Text Processing
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Stop words removal
- Porter Stemming algorithm
- String manipulation for text cleaning

### Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

### Clustering Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
- Silhouette Analysis for cluster evaluation

## Dependencies
```python
nltk
scikit-learn
scipy

Key Components
1-Text Preprocessing

Stop words removal for cleaning irrelevant words
Porter Stemming for normalizing words
Punctuation handling
Feature Extraction

TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text to numerical features
PCA for reducing dimensionality while preserving information
Clustering Analysis

Multiple clustering approaches:
K-Means for partitional clustering
Hierarchical clustering for tree-based grouping
Silhouette scoring for evaluating cluster quality
Dataset
The project expects a text dataset (.tsv format) containing news articles for clustering.

Usage
Ensure all required libraries are installed and import the necessary modules as shown in the code. The clustering pipeline can then be applied to a text dataset for news article categorization. ```
