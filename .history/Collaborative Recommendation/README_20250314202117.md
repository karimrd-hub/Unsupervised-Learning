# Movie Recommendation System Using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

## Project Overview
This project implements an item-based collaborative filtering approach for movie recommendations. The system analyzes movie ratings patterns to suggest similar movies to users based on their preferences.

## Features
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Cosine similarity metric for movie comparisons
- K-nearest neighbors algorithm for finding similar movies
- Weekly model update capability
- Movie recommendations based on title search

## Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity
- **Data Processing**: Sparse matrix representation of user-movie interactions
- **Libraries Used**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scipy.sparse
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Dataset
The project uses two main datasets:
- `movies.csv`: Contains movie information (ID, title, genres)
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings data

## Why Item-Based Filtering?
Item-based filtering is preferred over user-based approaches because:
- Movie relationships remain relatively stable
- Requires less frequent model updates (weekly vs daily)
- More computationally efficient for large datasets

## Usage
The system provides movie recommendations through the `get_movie_recommendation()` function:
```python
get_movie_recommendation('movie_name')
