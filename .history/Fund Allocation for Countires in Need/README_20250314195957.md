# Fund Allocation For Countries in Need Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements various clustering techniques to help an international associat(an NGO) make data-driven decisions for allocating $10 million in aid to countries most in need. The analysis uses socio-economic and health factors to categorize countries based on their development needs.

## Data
The project uses Country-data.csv which contains various socio-economic and health indicators for different countries, including:
- GDP
- Income indicators
- Child mortality rates
- Health metrics
- Other development factors

## Techniques Implemented
The analysis employs multiple unsupervised learning techniques:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Dimensionality reduction
   - Feature importance analysis

2. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - K-means Clustering
   - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
   - Hierarchical Clustering

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and exploration
2. Feature scaling and normalization
3. PCA implementation for dimensionality reduction
4. Application of multiple clustering techniques
5. Cluster analysis and interpretation
6. Country categorization based on aid priority

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn



## Implementation
The complete implementation can be found in the Jupyter notebook: clustering-pca-k-means-dbscan-hierarchical.ipynb

## Project Goal
The primary objective is to identify and categorize countries based on their socio-economic conditions to ensure effective allocation of the $10 million aid fund to the most deserving countries.

## Expected Outcome
- Clearly categorized groups of countries based on development needs
- Data-driven insights for aid allocation
- Strategic fund distribution recommendations
- Identification of countries requiring immediate assistance
